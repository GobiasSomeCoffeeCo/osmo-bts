=== Message Limitation Details

[[CHANNEL_ACTIVATION]]
==== Channel Activation

When used on a timeslot using the non-standard channel combination
'NM_CHANC_OSMO_DYN' as configured by OML, the regular
RSL channel activation procedures can not only be used for activation
of circuit-switched channels, but also for activation of a PDCH.

See <<OSMOCOM_DYN_TS>>.

[[user_plane_txp_mgmt]]
=== User Plane Transport Management

This chapter defines the A-bis/IP specific RSL procedures that are
introduced in addition to the 3GPP TS 48.058 standard procedures.

In classic A-bis over E1, user plane traffic is carried over 16kBps
sub-slots of 64kBps E1 time-slots according to ETSI/3GPP TS 08.60.  As
the E1 line is a dedicated line between BTS and BSC, no further
addressing information is required.

In A-bis/IP as described by the present document, new RSL procedures
have been introduced to deal with the different properties of
the underlying IP based transport medium.

[[rsl_crcx]]
==== RSL Create Connection (CRCX)

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to allocate + bind
to a BTS-local UDP port for the subsequent transmission of user-plane
data via RTP.

To do so, the BSC sends the *Create Connection (CRCX)* message.  In case of
successful outcome, the BTS responds with *Create Connection (CRCX)
ACK*.  In case of any error, the BTS responds with *Create Connection
(CRCX) NACK*.

See <<rsl_crcx_msg>>, <<rsl_crcx_msg_ack>>, <<rsl_crcx_msg_nack>>

[[rsl_mdcx]]
==== RSL Modify Connection (MDCX)

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to modify an
already-bound BTS-local UDP port for user-plane RTP.  It is used in
particular to configure the remote IP address and UDP port to which the
BTS shall send user-plane RTP traffic.  This remote address is normally
either a Media Gateway (MGW) of some sort, but could also be the RTP
socket of the corresponding other leg of a mobile-to-mobile call.

To modify a user-plane connection, the BSC sends the *Modify Connection*
message.  In case of successful outcome, the BTS responds with
*Modify Connection (MDCX) ACK*.  In case of any error, the BTS responds
with *Modify Connection (MDCX) NACK*.

See <<rsl_mdcx_msg>>, <<rsl_mdcx_msg_ack>>, <<rsl_mdcx_msg_nack>>

[[rsl_dlcx]]
==== RSL Delete Connection (DLCX)

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to delete an
already-existing BTS-local UDP port for user-plane RTP.

To delete a user-plane connection, the BSC sends the *Delete Connection
(DLCX)* message.  In case of successful outcome, the BTS responds with
*Delete Connection (DLCX) ACK*.  In case of any error, the BTS responds
with *Delete Connection (DLCX) NACK*.

See <<rsl_dlcx_msg>>, <<rsl_dlcx_msg_ack>>, <<rsl_dlcx_msg_nack>>

[[rsl_dlcx_ind]]
==== RSL Delete Connection (DLCX) Indication

When a BTS-local UDP connection for user-plane RTP is automatically
released at the time of RF CHANNEL RELEASE, the BTS sends a unilateral,
non-acknowledged *RSL Delete Connection (DLCX) Indication* to the BSC.

See <<rsl_dlcx_ind_msg>>


[[rsl-dynamic-channels]]
=== Dynamic Channel Combinations

In the classic data model established by ETSI/3GPP for A-bis, each
timeslot (channel) is configured using a static channel combination by
means of A-bis OML.  Particularly in presence of GPRS services, this
is very inflexible and leads to inefficient use of air interface
resources.

As such, several methods have been implemented to overcome this
limitation.  The fundamental operation can be outlined like this:

* Configuration of a particular _dynamic_ channel combination via OML
* activation of TCH works like on a classic TCH channel combination
* activation of PDCH requires some specific PDCH activation procedure

There are two variants implemented in the OsmoBTS A-bis dialect:

[[ipa_style_pdch_mgmt]]
==== IPA Style Dynamic Channels

This method is used when OML uses 'NM_CHANC_IPAC_TCHFull_PDCH' (0x80)
as channel combination for the given time-slot.

'IPA style' refers to 'ip.access' compatible PDCH activation and deactivation.

When the IPA style dynamic channel combination _TCH/F or PDCH_
is set, the non-standard 'PDCH ACTIVATE' (<<pdch_act>>) and 'PDCH
DEACTIVATE' (<<pdch_deact>>) procedures are used for switching an idle
channel into PDCH mode and back into idle mode.

When the channel is used as TCH/F, regular circuit-switched activation
is performed, like on any traditional TCH/F.   However, the BSC must
make sure to first disable the PDCH on the timeslot, before activating
it as TCH/F. Likewise, any circuit-switched TCH/F on the channel must
be deactivated using standard RSL signalling, before the specific PDCH
related procedures are used to enable the PDCH.

[[pdch_act]]
===== PDCH Activate

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to activate an
IPA style dynamic TCH/F+PDCH channel in PDCH mode.

The operation is not supported on any other physical channel type.

See <<rsl_pdch_act>>, <<rsl_pdch_act_ack>>, <<rsl_pdch_act_nack>>

[[pdch_deact]]
===== PDCH Deactivate

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to deactivate an
active PDCH on any an IPA style dynamic TCH/F+PDCH channel.

The operation is not supported on any other physical channel type.

See <<rsl_pdch_deact>>, <<rsl_pdch_deact_ack>>, <<rsl_pdch_deact_nack>>

[[OSMOCOM_DYN_TS]]
==== Osmocom Style Dynamic Channels

This method is in use when OML uses
'NM_CHANC_OSMO_DYN' (0x90) for the given time-slot.

The activation of PDCH is performed by using the regular 'RSL CHANNEL ACTIVATE'
procedure according to <<CHANNEL_ACTIVATION>>, with these modifications:

* The 'C-bits' part of the 'Channel Number' IE take the non-standard binary
  value 11000 (C5 through C1 as seen in 3GPP TS 48.058 § 9.3.1).
* The 'A-bits' part of the 'Activation Type' IE take the non-standard binary
  value 1111, with an additional fourth bit (add A4 to A3 through A1 as seen in
  3GPP TS 48.058 § 9.3.3; all remaining reserved bits as well as the 'R' bit are
  coded as zero).
* The normally mandatory 'Channel Mode' IE is omitted; none of the optional IEs
  are included.

Hence the message consists of exactly these IEs:

[[etws]]
=== ETWS (Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System)

ETWS as specified in 3GPP TS 23.041 includes not only notification via
SMSCB, but also so-called Primary Notifications (PN).  The ETWS PN are
transmitted

 * by the BSC to all subscribers with active dedicated channels
 * by the BTS on the PCH to all subscribers in idle mode
 * by the PCU on the PACCH to all subscribers with active TBF

Unfortunately, 3GPP forgot to update their specifications with any
information as to how the ETWS PN is transmitted from BSC to BTS in
a portable way, and Osmocom had to invent their own non-standard
signaling for it.

See <<OSMO_ETWS_CMD>> for the Osmocom implementation.


=== BCCH carrier power reduction operation

According to 3GPP TS 45.008, section 7.1, the BCCH carrier (sometimes called C0) of
a BTS shall maintain discontinuous Downlink transmission at full power in order to
stay "visible" to the mobile stations.  Because of that, early versions of this 3GPP
document prohibited BS power reduction on C0.  However, a new feature was introduced
version 13.0.0 (2015-11) - "BCCH carrier power reduction operation".

This is a special mode of operation, in which the variation of RF power level for
some timeslots is relaxed for the purpose of energy saving.  In other words, the
output power on some timeslots, except the timeslot(s) carrying BCCH/CCCH, can be
lower than the full power.  In this case the maximum allowed difference is 6 dB.

Unfortunately, 3GPP did not specify in which way the BTS is instructed to activate
and deactivate the BCCH carrier power reduction mode.  Osmocom had to invent their
own non-standard approach: the BSC needs to send _BS POWER CONTROL_ message with
the _Channel Number_ IE set to 0x80 (BCCH) and the _Message Discriminator_ set to
0x06 (Common Channel Management messages).

All the above values are encoded in network byte order.

A detailed definition of the individual values is given in RFC 1889.

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_CONN_ID]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_CONN_ID

This IE is a TV with a value length of two bytes. The value is a 16 bit
connection ID in network byte order.


[[RSL_IE_IPAC_RTP_PAYLOAD2]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_RTP_PAYLOAD2

This information element contains the RTP payload identifier, which is
used in the PT (Payload Type) field of the RTP header in subsequent
transmissions of the RTP flow.

[[RSL_IE_OSMO_REP_ACCH_CAP]]
==== RSL_IE_OSMO_REP_ACCH_CAP

This is a one byte length TLV IE that is used to enable or disable repeated ACCH
capabilities on the BTS side during Channel Activation and Mode Modify.

The IE contains a bitfield in the lower nibble in order to set the ACCH repetition
policy for each of the two channel types individually. Depending on the state of the
bits (see table below) the ACCH repetition mode is either enabled or disabled completely.

The lower 3 bit of the higher nibble are used to signal an RXQUAL threshold to set the
BER on which UL-SACCH or DL-FACCH repetition shall be turned on. If the field is set
to 0, then UL-SACCH and DL-FACCH will be always on. DL-FACCH will also be turned on
automatically as soon as the MS requests a DL-SACCH repetition.

If the IE is not present, then ACCH repetition completely is disabled.

(Bits 7 is reserved for future use and must be set to zero.)

[[RSL_IE_OSMO_TRAINING_SEQUENCE]]
==== RSL_IE_OSMO_TRAINING_SEQUENCE

This TLV IE instructs the BTS to use a specific training sequence set and
training sequence code for a given lchan. It is sent by OsmoBSC in RSL CHANNEL
ACTIVATION and MODE MODIFY messages to the BTS, iff the BTS is VAMOS-capable,
i.e. if an Abis-over-IP connected BTS indicated BTS_FEAT_VAMOS in the OML BTS
features (Manufacturer Id information element, see <<NM_ATT_MANUF_ID>>).

If this information element is present, the receiver shall ignore any other
training sequence set and training sequence code bits from other information
elements of the same RSL message.

This is an Osmocom-specific extension of the RSL layer, which was added to
express more than two TSC sets. For VAMOS operation, OsmoBSC selects from one
of four separate training sequence codings per modulation scheme, while usual
RSL IEs are only able to express a single-bit TSC set number. For clarity, this
IE contains both the TSC set and the TSC in one IE, and is defined as
overruling any other IEs containing TSC or TSC set numbers.

The first value octet indicates the training sequence set, and the second octet
indicates the training sequence code to be used. Receiving values from a
reserved value range should be considered an error condition.

| octet 2 |  length of the value part (2)
| octet 3 |  TSC set
| octet 4 |  TSC
|===

The training sequence set (TSC set) is coded like the 'CS Domain TSC Set' bits,
as defined in the 'Extended TSC Set' IE in 3GPP TS 44.018 10.5.2.82
<<3gpp-ts-44-018>>, and corresponds to the 'TSC Set' as defined in 3GPP TS
45.002 <<3gpp-ts-45-002>>. The encoded training sequence set number ranges from
0 to 3, any other values are reserved for future use. The encoded 0 corresponds
to TSC Set 1, see <<RSL_IE_OSMO_TRAINING_SEQUENCE__TSC_set_coding>>.

=== A-bis RSL Initialization / BTS bring-up

Upon receiving the 'IPA RSL CONNECT' OML message by the respective
'Baseband Transceiver' MO, the BTS proceeds with establishing a separate
TCP connection for the given TRX.

[[rsl-msc-pri]]
.A-bis RSL BTS bring-up for primary TRX
["mscgen"]
----
include::rsl-startup-pri.msc[]
----

[[rsl-msc-sec]]
.A-bis RSL BTS bring-up for secondary TRXs
["mscgen"]
----
include::rsl-startup-sec.msc[]
----

The initialization of the primary and secondary TRX slightly differ, as
illustrated by the differences of <<rsl-msc-pri>> and <<rsl-msc-sec>>.
Since the secondary TRX has no BCCH, it does not (need to) receive any 'RSL
BCCH INFORMATION' messages from the BSC.
